Two things can be gained through freezing balance:

a.	Entropy points. Each update of blockchain transaction consumes entropy points (if more than 10s from the previous transaction, the current transaction does not consume any points). Entropy points obtained=sun*frozen duration. Each transaction (all operations altering blockchain accounts) consumes 100,000 entropy points.  
b.	Votes. The amount of votes gained equals to the amount of frozen TRX.

Transaction: returns transaction. Request transaction broadcasting after signed by wallet.  
27.5 Function  
Balance can be unfrozen only 3 days after the latest freeze. Voting records will be cleared upon unfrozen balance, while entropy points won’t be. Frozen balance will not be automatically unfrozen after 3 days’ duration.
