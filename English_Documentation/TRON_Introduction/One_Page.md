# TRON

## What is TRON?

TRON is an ambitious project dedicated to the establishment of a truly decentralized Internet and its infrastructure. The Tron Protocol, one of the largest blockchain based operating systems in the world, offers base public blockchain support of high throughput, high scalability and high availability for all decentralized applications in the TRON ecosystem. 

## Key Features

+ High Throughput

Under Tron consensus, a limited number of nodes of high calculation performance are selected by users as network witnesses, achieving high throughput by keeping the TPS of the entire network on an acceptable level. With its exclusive consensus, Tron has surpassed Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of TPS.

High TPS guarantees low calculation delay, speeding up transactions to parallel the velocity of existing payment systems such as VISA and SWIFT, which makes daily payment a possibility.  

+ Scalability
     
Applications are given a wider variety of ways to be deployed in TRON because of its scalability and highly effective smart contract.

Thanks to the high efficiency and infinite possibilities of the smart contract, Tron possesses great scalability, allowing for a wide variety of applications to be deployed in Tron.

The marriage of an excellent database structure and the account system simplifies the actualization of complex designs and models, which brings convenience to project development and supports high TPS. Existing applications, websites and operating services can be transferred to TRON network by its large user base, which allows TRON to better rival against existing institutions.

+ Highly Availability

TRON is keen on building a decentralized consensus mechanism.  The network structure, user assets and intrinsic values will become more reliable with a higher degree of decentralization. Even so, the consensus mechanism of TRON is much more energy-efficient compared with the POW mode.

+ Low Cost

TRON adopts a design with low calculation cost, which makes it easier for different apps on Tron to expand its user base and more commercially competitive .

+ User-friendly

TRON is committed to building utility blockchain products with thorough research on  users’ demands and expectations.

## Core Design

+ Unique Consensus

Under TRON’s improved POS consensus, several elected nodes, which share equal rights and deployed by global users themselves, cooperate to accomplish calculation tasks.
High-performance, decentralized/distributed nodes are spontaneously chosen by TRON holders who have interest in individual and community prosperity and wealth.

+ Smart Contract with High Efficiency

It will be fulfilled in the following ways:

   + TRON supports JAVA development—a programming language that has mature development communities, supports multiple scenarios and is highly effective.
   + High-efficiency consensus mechanism 
   + TRON embraces excellent database structure and account system to help users with the conversion from complex conceptions and models into utility applications.

## The Future of TRON 

We aim to build a TRON ecosystem that everyone can participate in and benefit from, with the Tron network along with its many advantages as the cornerstone of our effort.

+ Tron and its wide variety of affiliated DAPPs not only render users reduced costs, but also improved convenience in daily life and financial return. 
+ By deploying their DAPPs on Tron, developers can expand their scope of business and bring publicity to their values and beliefs.
+ Witnesses supports the functioning of Tron network and gain remuneration for their effort.

Whether a user, developer or Tron’ selected witness, each and every one of us devotes ourselves to the construction and prosperity of Tron’s ecosystem and be rewarded for our commitment.
